# 🐳 Docker Testing – Complete Guide

## 📌 Introduction

Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into a single unit called a container. Testing Docker ensures that:
- Docker is installed correctly
- Images are built properly
- Containers run as expected
- Networking and ports function correctly
- Logs and debugging tools work
- Resources are managed efficiently

Docker testing is an important step in DevOps pipelines and local development environments.
